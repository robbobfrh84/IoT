# Next 3

# To Do 🔥

Misc `Iot`
- [ ] Review wifi examples, makes sure none show your password/wifi etc...
  - looking in the actual repo after 👆big push should make it easy to see if they exist
  - also searh the id/pass variable throughout the Iot repo...
- [ ] After 8x8 update. Push all here and update Iot on Pi.
  - 🤷‍♀️Maybe test uploading 8x8 on pie...???
