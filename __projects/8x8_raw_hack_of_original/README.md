NOTE: since moving onto mostly just esp8266, I realized this is pretty hacky and for some reason it has to try to connect to wifi or it won't animate, but it can fail... it's weird. JUST start over with esp8266 if you wanna do anything else from here. it's too much just to get to work normal. But, should work without "really" connecting to wifi (even though it HAS to try)...
