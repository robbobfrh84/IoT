# Serve basic Web application MKR1000

The MKR1000 Version of html & API may be much more raw than the ESP8266 version. I only did this one a bit quick and dirty because I did it before the ESP8266, which I plan on being the more used and thoughtout code to use... because I plan to use that board. ALSO, the libraries for the ESP8266 are much more documented and seemingly extensive than the MKRs. Tho... I wrote this before doing the ESP8266 version. So... this note and thought may need to be updated. 

### NOTE: 
- Default delay is 1000ms for checking push botton
- However, clicking the html check button should be instant.
- I tested a lowered dealy of 100ms, which seemed to work, giving more instant(ish) relay of button state.
